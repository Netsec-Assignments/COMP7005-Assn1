Build Instructions
==================
~~Client~~
1. Install cmake: dnf install cmake
2. In the root directory (containing src/, doc/ etc.): mkdir build && cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. The client and server executables will be in <project root>/build/bin.

Note: if you're having C++11 problems (e.g. nullptr isn't defined), run dnf update gcc-c++ to update g++.

~~Server~~
TODO (I'll also have to change my CMakeLists.txt to not build the server)


Running the Programs
